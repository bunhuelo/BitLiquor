BitLiquor
=========

BitLiquor - the symmetric 4-bit encryption for the law-abiding citizen who has nothing to hide.

BitLiquor is a 4-bit symmetric cipher for the law-abiding citizen. If you have nothing to hide, BitLiquor is your choice. It has the following advantages over other far spread ciphers like AES or Twofish:

* Easy key recovery - you forgot your key? No problem, brute forcing is so simple it can be done manually.
* Safety - support your intelligence agency. Cracking BitLiquor encrypted files is inexpensive and makes the work of your local law enforcement agencies easier.
* Fairness - only every second byte is actually encrypted, this again is your personal contribution to the war on terrorism.
* Speed - the BitLiquor block cipher only uses 2 rounds and is therefore extremely fast.
* Secrecy - criminals that steal your laptop won't immediately be able to read your encrypted data (this applies only to every second byte).

BUILD:
Easy peasy - make sure you have gcc installed and run "make". Good luck!
