Welcome to BitLiquor (absolutely unrelated to Microsoft™ BitLocker™).

I. WHAT IS IT?
The BitLiquor Cryptosuite offers you:
- an implementation of the BitLiquor cipher
- an executable command line tool which you can use to encrypt files or everything
  else you throw into the pipeline.
  
II. BUILDING & INSTALLING
Make sure you have a C compiler installed. If you are a Windows user I can't tell you
how to do this, if you use Debian, run 'apt-get install gcc' as root user, if you use
Ubuntu, run 'sudo apt-get install build-essential', for Fedora try 'yum install gcc'
as root user.
Being prepared so far, clone the blcipher git repository using 
  git clone https://github.com/bunhuelo/BitLiquor.git
change into the BitLiquor folder and run:
  make clean && make
and if you want to install the blpipe tool:
  sudo make install
or to remove it again
  sudo make uninstall

III. USAGE
The blpipe tool is run like this:
  blpipe [--encrypt|--decrypt] <key>
After installing blpipe you can encrypt a file 'test.txt' using the key 'password' 
like this:
  cat test.txt | blpipe --encrypt password > test.txt.encrypted
Please make sure you mark encrypted content by appending ".encrypted" to the name to
make sure the NSA won't have any difficulties to seperate encrypted files from
random junk after consfiscating your computer.
In order to decrypt the file, use:
  cat test.txt.encrypted | blpipe --decrypt password > test.txt

IV. IF YOU'RE THE NSA
Please read this only if you're a member of the NSA.
In order to protect the country and crack e.g. a BitLiquor-encrypted file called
supersecret.txt.encrypted, please run:
  cat supersecret.txt.encrypted | blpipe --decrypt a > supersecret.a.txt
  cat supersecret.txt.encrypted | blpipe --decrypt b > supersecret.b.txt
  ...
  cat supersecret.txt.encrypted | blpipe --decrypt p > supersecret.p.txt
As a quick reference, here is the relevant part of the alphabet in case you forgot it:
  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p
Now comes the hard part - either use one of your super computer clusters or a file
manager in order to open supersecret.a.txt till supersecret.p.txt. One of the files
will definitely contain the plain text.

V. DISCLAIMER
No piece of software is perfect. The developers of this piece of software are not
responsible for any damage done to your computer or your personal life by using
blpipe or any other implementation of the BitLiquor cipher.
Please report errors or sloppy code! BitLiquor is a security product and we'll attempt
to fulfill the high standards that are applied to security software.

VI. ACTUAL DISCLAIMER
If you still didn't get that this is not a serious product: BitLiquor is NOT A REAL
CIPHER. DO NOT get the stupid idea to protect your company secrets or personal data
using BitLiquor. BitLiquor is a technology demonstrator - it will demonstrate that
also a completely useless cipher can make your data look well protected and 
unreadable, and that sometimes crypto products are so poorly designed that they don't
need a backdoor in order to be unsafe. Thanks for your attention.
